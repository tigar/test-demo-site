I write code for algorithmic art, draw, bake lots of bread, rock climb, and make mobile apps.

I graduated Carleton College in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and incredible friends. 

I spent the fall after college at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), an educational retreat for programmers in Brooklyn, NY, that I cannot recommend enough for anyone and everyone who considers themselves a programmer. 

I currently work at Blackline Inc. and am based in Berkeley, CA.
