In 2022 I felt it was time to update to a new website. I was particularly intrigued by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a webhost, rather than my previous Jeykll site. The automated build tools and overall development experience has been fantastic.
